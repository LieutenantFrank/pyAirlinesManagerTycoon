# pyAirlinesManagerTycoon
Python scripts to automate Airlines Manager Tycoon

The pricing.py script goes through all your routes one by one and checks if you can run an internal audit.
If possible the script will perform the audit and update the prices for this route.

You'll need to get Selenium and Chromedriver

Chromedriver:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Edit the pricing.py file and enter your username and password!

I had to start the cmd window as administrator for it to work
once you're ready just run 
python pricing.py
